 I will be using machine learning for predicting mortality caused by Heart Failure, by training a model based on current clinical records consisting of the patients heart faliure causes and symptoms and also evaluating the accuracy of this model at the end. I believe this will be a cost-effective way of assisting individuals in detecting survival rates, as they can simply indicate the presence of causes and symptoms that would make a patient's clinical record appear more critical compared to other heart failure patients and give early treatment to those at high risk. With such a system in place, there is a possibility of reducing the number of mortality rates.This information can guide the development of targeted interventions to prevent cardiovascular diseases at a population level.
