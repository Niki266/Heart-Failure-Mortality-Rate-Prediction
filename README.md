# Heart Failure Mortality Rate Prediction

I will be using machine learning for predicting mortality caused by Heart Failure, by training a model based on current clinical records consisting of the patients heart faliure causes and symptoms. I will evaluate the accuracy of this model at the end. This project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.
- Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms.
- Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook

### Running the Notebook
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Run the `Data science project.ipynb` notebook to explore the analysis and predictions.
